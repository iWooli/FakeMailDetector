FakeMailDetector
================

A very simple php class that helps to detect fake emails when users sign up.
It already contains a certain number of undesired email domains.
If you know more domains that are not listed here, your help will be appreciated.


How to use?

You can find a really simple exemple.php file within the project.


Why?

As a webdevelopper, i know how unpleasant it can be to find tons of fake account created in your admin area. 
This simple class drastically helps to reduce the amount of those fake accounts.
It also focus only on domains without their extensions so you don't have to worry if that domain has multiple extensions.

Any help to improve will be appreciated!
